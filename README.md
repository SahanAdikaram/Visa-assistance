How to Run
To start the project in GitHub Codespaces or your local environment:
- Run:
*npm start*
- ⚠️ Wait a few moments for the environment to finish setting up. If you see an error or the command doesn't work, open a new terminal and try running npm start again.
- If that still doesn't work, open two separate terminals:
- Frontend:
*cd frontend*
*npm run dev*
- Backend:
*cd backend*
*node server.js*
