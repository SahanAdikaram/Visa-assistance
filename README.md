How to start the project in GitHub Codespaces:
- Run:
*npm start*
- ⚠️ Wait a few moments for the environment to finish setting up. If you see an error or the command doesn't work, open a new terminal and try running npm start again.
- If that still doesn't work, open two separate terminals:
- Frontend:
*cd frontend* and then
*npm run dev*
- Backend:
*cd backend* and then
*node server.js*

## 🚀 Running the App in Codespaces

1. Dependencies for root, frontend, and backend are installed automatically (including `concurrently`).
2. After Codespaces finishes setup, just run:

```bash
npm start
